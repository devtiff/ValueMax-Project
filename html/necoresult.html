        <h1>BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CREATION OF NECO</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="biograph">

        <p>The establishment of the National Examinations Council (NECO) in April 1999, is a culmination of reaction of
            the Federal
            Government to widespread escalating agitations for a national examination outfit that would be responsive to
            the
            Nigerian needs and demands as well as cope with the annually increasing number of secondary school
            candidates to take
            Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) nationwide. Series of panels had earlier been set up to address
            the issues
            before this vital decision was taken.

            The origin of the issues dates back to 1977, during the Murtala/Obasanjo administration, when there was a
            widespread
            leakage of West African School Certificate Examination WASSCE questions. The public outcry that greeted the
            mass leakage
            led the Federal Government to set up the Sogbetun commission of enquiry with specific mandate to look into
            the remote
            causes of the leakage and make appropriate recommendations to government. Key among the findings of the
            committee was
            that the workload of WAEC was beyond its capacity, hence, it was difficult for WAEC to effectively manage
            the conduct of
            a hitch-free examination. The Sogbetun commission recommended among other things, the establishment of
            additional
            examination bodies to reduce the workload of WAEC and make it more efficient. The recommendation of the
            committee was
            not implemented at the time.

            In 1982, WAEC admitted before the house of representatives committee on education that Nigeria needed to
            establish
            additional examination bodies with a view to ceding some of its responsibilities to enable it function more
            efficiently.
            As the problem persisted, the Shehu Shagari government, set up the Angulu panel to review the
            recommendations of the
            Sogbetun commission and make recommendations. The Angulu panel recommended the establishment of three
            regional
            examination bodies each with a specific mandate different from one another. The Angulu panel’s
            recommendation was also
            not implemented. The problem of WAEC’s inability to manage the ever-increasing numerous problems, became
            evident in 1989
            to the extent that the Babangida administration had to act quickly in order to rescue Nigeria from ever
            increasing
            problems bedevilling WAEC leading to her inability to conduct confidence-inspiring examinations. Government
            at the time
            had to set up the Okoro panel and charged it to quickly review the recommendations of all previous panels.
            The Okoro
            panel’s recommendations were virtually the same with those of Sogbetun (1977) and Angulu (1982), which was
            also not
            immediately implemented.

            By 1991 when the late professor Babs Fafunwa saw the lack of political will to implement previous
            recommendations, he
            decided to set up a taskforce chaired by professor Osiyale, to articulate all the previous recommendations
            with a view
            to setting up the machinery for implementation. The report of the Osiyale taskforce, led to the
            establishment of
            National Board for Educational Measurement (NBEM) and the National Business and Technical Examinations Board
            (NABTEB) in
            1992, through the enabling decrees 69 and 70 establishing NBEM and NABTEB respectively, which were
            promulgated in 1993.
            The National Board for Educational Measurement (NBEM) took charge of conducting the National Common Entrance

            Examination (NCEE) for admission of candidates into the Federal Unity Colleges (FUC’s) and the Suleja
            Academy. NBEM was
            also charged with the responsibility of conducting the Junior School Certificate Examination (JSCE) for
            Federal Unity
            Colleges and other allied institutions that were hitherto conducted by WAEC. The National Business and
            Technical
            Examinations Board (NABTEB) took charge of conducting business, technical and trade examinations that were
            also hitherto
            conducted by WAEC and the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) of London and the City & Guilds of London Institute.
            Consequently,
            the workload of WAEC was drastically reduced.

            In 1997, the Abacha administration set up the Etsu Nupe panel to re-examine the Nigerian education system.
            In the same
            year, the vision 2020 was set up by the Federal Government with a committee on review of the Nigeria’s
            Education system.
            Both the Etsu Nupe panel and the vision 2020 committee observed that in spite of the drastic reduction in
            its workload,
            WAEC’s challenges still persisted and therefore recommended the establishment of an indigenous examination
            body parallel
            to WAEC as Nigeria’s home-grown alternative examination body. The harmonized report of the two committees
            was published
            in January 1998. The published report was presented at the 46 th meeting of the National Council on
            Education (NCE) held
            at Abeokuta Ogun state in March 1999, where a resolution to upgrade the National Board for Educational
            Measurement
            (NBEM) into a full-scale national examination outfit of the same standard as WAEC was passed. A policy to
            create the
            National Examinations Council (NECO) was formulated. Consequently, NBEM became the nucleus of NECO. NBEM’s
            capacity was
            built by employing additional qualified personnel, acquiring more equipment and facilities and upgrading the
            existing
            ones. NBEM was therefore made stronger and its capacity was upgraded and enhanced to meet international
            standards. NBEM
            was then transformed to become National Examinations Council (NECO). NECO then commenced its maiden Senior
            School
            Certificate Examination (SSCE) in June/July 2000, with resounding success. NECO also successfully continued
            to discharge
            all the mandates of NBEM in addition to the conduct of the Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE)
            without
            prejudice to the existing functions and powers of WAEC. The enabling decree 33 of 1999 establishing the
            National
            Examinations Council (NECO) became an act of parliament cited as the “National Examinations Council (NECO)
            (establishment) act 2002.</p>

                        The story of NECO and its achievements is a continuously developing one and cannot be completely
                        told in a
                        piece as
                        short as this. However, as has been observed elsewhere, Perhaps, the greatest achievement of
                        NECO is that it
                        has
                        provided gainful employment for over a thousand Nigerians [and given hope to thousands more –
                        candidates who
                        had been
                        able to keep their matriculation dates because of the timely release of their results by NECO].
